The project focuses on making home healthcare information accessible, structured, and easy to compare.

## The Problem & Solution

### The Problem
Families, especially new mothers, face difficulty in finding trusted and experienced Mother & Baby Care Nurses. Available information is often scattered and not presented in a clear, comparable format.

### The Solution
Heal At Home provides a centralized digital platform that:

- Lists available nurses clearly
- Displays experience and expertise
- Shows daily service pricing

This improves accessibility and decision-making for families seeking home healthcare services.
