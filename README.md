## Project Description

Heal At Home is a frontend web application that displays Mother & Baby Care Nurses available across different cities. The platform allows users to view nurse profiles including experience, specialization, and daily pricing in a clean card-based interface.

The project focuses on making home healthcare information accessible, structured, and easy to compare.

## The Problem & Solution

### The Problem
Families, especially new mothers, face difficulty in finding trusted and experienced Mother & Baby Care Nurses. Available information is often scattered and not presented in a clear, comparable format.

### The Solution
Heal At Home provides a centralized digital platform that:

- Lists available nurses clearly
- Displays experience and expertise
- Shows daily service pricing
- Helps users compare options easily

This improves accessibility and decision-making for families seeking home healthcare services.
